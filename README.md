# Future of High Performance Computing with Quantum Workshop

Welcome to the **Future of High Performance Computing with Quantum Workshop repository**! This repository contains all the materials and resources for the Section 2 and Section 3 of the workshop track, which will be held on 2 March 2023 at Singapore Expo Convention & Exhibition Centre, Max Atria, Level 2 #212-213.

# Overview

The Future of High Performance Computing with Quantum Workshop is a With an overview introduction of quantum computing, near-term quantum algorithms and tools like the [Circuit Knitting Toolbox](https://research.ibm.com/blog/circuit-knitting-with-classical-communication), [Quantum Serverless](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-serverless-programming), and [Qiskit application modules](https://research.ibm.com/blog/qiskit-application-modules), this workshop aims to inspire participants in the field of quantum computing and its potential to revolutionize the computing industry with hands-on demonstrations of the latest [Qiskit and IBM Quantum offerings](https://qiskit.org/). Whether you’re just starting out, looking to expand your skills, or seeking to deepen your understanding, the tools and knowledge exposure gained in this workshop will be an add on value to all learners, irrespective of their levels and backgrounds.

# Prerequisites
To attend the workshop here are some recommended prerequisites to help you get started:

- You will need an account with IBM Quantum, it’s fast to make and completely free. Please register yourself here: https://quantum-computing.ibm.com. Be sure that you remember your sign-in credentials as those would be required for you to access IBM Quantum service providing all the open IBM Quantum resources.
- A browser fully up-to-date (Chrome or Firefox are recommended) as all teaching will be done on tools using IBM Quantum on the Cloud. There will be no need to download anything and everything can be done from yourlaptop for general hands-on coding.
- There is very little background needed for the sessions. For example, if you know how to multiply two matrices , and have some very basic programming experience in Python, you are more than ready to get started. You can brush up on Python programming before attending the lecture by using the Qiskit Textbook. To make the most out of these lectures, you may also consider looking through the linear algebra prerequisites section of the Qiskit Textbook.
